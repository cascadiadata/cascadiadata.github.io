## Cascadia Urban Analytics Cooperative Video

A new Cascadia Urban Analytics Cooperative video showcases the Data Science for Social Good fellowship programs at the University of Washington's [eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/) and the University of British Columbia's [Data Science Institute](https://dsi.ubc.ca/).

* Academic directors of CUAC and a leader at Microsoft explain the mission of the cross-border initiative and their vision for improving quality of life, city operations, investment and innovation in the region.
* UBC Fellow Mina Park explains her team's urban data science project to identify priority routes for public transit service upgrades in Surrey, B.C.
* Speakers discuss the importance of applying collaborative data science using real-world data to urban social issues that are common across the region.

CUAC, which was [launched in February 2017](http://www.washington.edu/news/2017/02/23/universities-establish-joint-center-to-use-data-for-social-good-in-cascadia-region/), is a Microsoft-funded initiative that unities faculty, researchers and students from UW and UBC as part of the [Cascadia Innovation Corridor](https://news.microsoft.com/2017/09/12/new-partnerships-advance-the-cascadia-innovation-corridor/). The initiative is run jointly by the [Data Science Institute]( https://dsi.ubc.ca/) at UBC and the [Urbanalytics]( http://urbanalytics.uw.edu/) unit at UW, which was launched through [Urban@UW](http://urban.uw.edu/) to integrate data science into multidisciplinary urban research efforts across the university.
