On Wednesday, August 21st, four interdisciplinary teams will present the results of their work this summer at the [Data Science for Social Good (DSSG)](https://escience.washington.edu/dssg/) program at the UW [eScience Institute's](https://escience.washington.edu/).

The DSSG program brings together student fellows, stakeholders, and data and domain researchers to work on focused, collaborative projects for societal benefit. Fifteen fellows will present the exciting results of their 10-week [data science-focused projects](https://escience.washington.edu/2019-data-science-for-social-good-projects/) at this event. You can learn more about the team members [here](https://escience.washington.edu/data-science-for-social-good-teams-summer-2019/).

The projects are:
* [ADUniverse: Evaluating the Feasibility of (Affordable) Accessory Dwelling Units in Seattle](https://escience.washington.edu/team-develops-prototype-tool-on-accessory-dwelling-units-for-homeowners/)
* [Developing an Algorithmic Equity Toolkit with Government, Advocates, and Community Partners](https://escience.washington.edu/team-develops-algorithmic-equity-toolkit-at-data-science-for-social-good-program/)
* [Understanding Congestion Pricing, Travel Behavior, and Price Sensitivity](https://escience.washington.edu/data-science-for-social-good-team-analyzes-equity-of-congestion-pricing-on-interstate-405/)
* [Natural Language Processing for Peer Support in Online Mental Health Communities](https://escience.washington.edu/data-science-for-social-good-team-analyzes-peer-support-data-to-understand-helpfulness/)

[DSSG Final Presentations](https://escience.washington.edu/events/dssg-final-presentation/) will take place from 3-5pm Wednesday, August 21st in the [Physics/Astronomy Auditorium, room A118](https://escience.washington.edu/locations/physicsastronomy-auditorium-room-a118/).
