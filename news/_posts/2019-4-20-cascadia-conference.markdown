Project teams from the [2018 Data Science for Social Good program](https://escience.washington.edu/data-science-for-social-good-program-results/) at the University of Washington's [eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu/) have continued to showcase their work following the conclusion of their summer projects.

Christopher Haberland, a fellow on the [Disaster Damage Detection project](/images/news/dssg_disasters_poster.pdf) team, and Kellie MacPhee, a fellow on the [Out-of-School Resources project](/images/news/dssg_osr_cascadia.pdf) team, traveled to Vancouver, B.C. to present posters at the [Cascadia Innovation Corridor Conference](https://cascadiaconference.com/) in October 2018. 

The annual conference joins leaders from business, academia, and government from Vancouver to Portland to explore new strategies for collaboration and shared economic opportunities.
The 2018 event marked the third annual conference since the [Cascadia Innovation Corridor](https://news.microsoft.com/2017/09/12/new-partnerships-advance-the-cascadia-innovation-corridor/) was launched by Microsoft in September 2016. Partner organizations also include the [Business Council of British Columbia](https://www.bcbc.com/), [Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce](https://www.seattlechamber.com/home), [Challenge Seattle](https://www.challengeseattle.com/), [BC Tech Association](http://www.wearebctech.com/), [Washington Technology](https://www.washingtontechnology.org/) and the [Washington Roundtable](http://www.waroundtable.com/).

Christopher Haberland said: "I was glad to have the opportunity to present my team's research at this transnational initiative to further improve the economic, environmental, and social commonwealth of Cascadia. It was inspiring to learn about how government and industry leaders are investing in the social, organizational, and technological capital that will make the region uniquely prepared to respond to a changing world."

Kellie MacPhee said: "The Cascadia Innovation Corridor Conference was a unique opportunity to connect with researchers and policy makers interested in cross-border collaborations. For me, highlights included hearing Governor Inslee and Premier Horgan talk candidly about climate and business initiatives, and the idea-thon sessions where attendees brainstormed ways to use new technology and cross-border collaborations to support sustainability in agriculture and other kinds of innovations."

Karen Lavi and Jose Hernandez, data scientists for the Out-of-School Resources project, presented a [poster](/images/news/dssg_osr_westhub.pdf) at the [West Big Data Innovation Hub's All Hands Meeting](https://westbigdatahub.org/featured-events/all-hands-2018/) in Boise, Idaho in September 2018. Two additional fellows from the team, Sreekanth Krishnaiah and Haowen Zheng, presented a [project poster](/images/news/dssg_osr_aefp.pdf) at the [Association for Education Finance and Policy's 44th Annual Conference](http://aefpweb.org/conferences/home) in Kansas City, Missouri in March 2019. Fellows from the Seattle Mobility Index Project also presented at the West Hub All Hands meeting.
