The fourth annual [Data Science for Social Good](https://escience.washington.edu/dssg/) (DSSG) program at the eScience Institute culminated on August 17th with final presentations from three interdisciplinary teams. The 15 DSSG [Student Fellows](https://escience.washington.edu/meet-the-2018-data-science-for-social-good-fellows/) – representing fields from public policy and sociology to biology, statistics and electrical engineering – presented their findings based on 10 weeks of full-time work with in-house data scientists and project leads from the academic, nonprofit and public sectors. Stakeholders, students and members of the public attended the presentations. The DSSG program combines technical skills with socially relevant projects to benefit the public good.
