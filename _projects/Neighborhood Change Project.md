# Neighborhood Change Project

After decades of research, scholars have determined that where you live matters. Now, we need to explore how place affects individuals and families. The Neighborhood Change Project represents a group of academics and researchers at the University of Washington and the University of British Columbia who are investigating the effects of neighborhood change and segregation on racial and socioeconomic differences in health, housing, migration, and poverty. Using interdisciplinary methodologies in data urban analytics, statistics, sociology, health, and policy research, the project examines both macro-level and micro-level dynamics in the rapidly changing cities of Seattle, Vancouver, and Surrey.

On May 9th, 2019, Governor Jay Inslee signed Senate Bill 5600 into law, bringing a series of amendments to landlord-tenant law, including an extension of the notice to vacate from 3 to 14 days for evictions based on overdue rent. This followed testimony by University of Washington researcher [Dr. Timothy A. Thomas](https://timathomas.github.io/), lead researcher for the Washington Evictions Research Project and co-lead of the CUAC Neighborhood Change Project, in front of the Senate Housing Stability & Affordability Committee and other government entities.
