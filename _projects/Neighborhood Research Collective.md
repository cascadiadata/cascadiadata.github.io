# Neighborhood Research Collective

After decades of research, scholars have determined that where you live matters. Now, we need to explore how place affects individuals and families. The Neighborhood Research Collective (NRC) is a group of academics and researchers at the University of Washington and the University of British Columbia that are investigating the effects of neighborhood change and segregation on racial and socioeconomic differences in health, housing, migration, and poverty. Using interdisciplinary methodologies in data urban analytics, statistics, sociology, health, and policy research the NRC examines both macro-level and micro-level dynamics in the rapidly changing cities of Seattle, Vancouver, and Surrey.
